#Make Coders Website

## Overview

A coding learning aggregator focused on Full Stack Javascript.

## Content

I am pulling together some thoughts and resources that will drive the content for the website.

### Thoughts

Below are some thoughts on why new developers should start with Javascript.

#### Kevin Baker
> Javascript is an easy to learn programming language that works everywhere. It is the only language I know of that can be used for all major mobile platforms, web and server development. Traditionally a programmer would need to learn a separate programming language for each platform. 
>
>From a learning standpoint Javascript is very efficient, since it allows a developer to get started on most major platforms with one programming language. This just opens up all kinds of possibilities.
> 
> Keep in mind that there are  zillion ways to combine technology into the “Stack” you will be using. Initially it’s good to focus on technologies that are reusable across platforms and popular in the market simply because you will get better and higher paying work when you are ready. 


#### Sitepoint
> Initially, all JavaScript development and innovation was done in the browser because that was the only context that supported the language. As time passed, web developers started to realize that many of JavaScript's most useful features (that it's non-blocking, it's event-driven, that it's a familiar language for many) could be leveraged in environments other than the browser. This kick-started a second round of innovation in the JavaScript community that resulted in JavaScript running on servers and on databases.
>
>Suddenly, knowing JavaScript didn't automatically pigeonhole you as a "front end web developer." If you know the language well, you can build servers and databases, in addition to front end user experiences. Now, for the first time, developers can build an entire web application using only JavaScript. This trend is often called things like "full stack JavaScript" or "pure JavaScript 


#### Smashing Magazine

>The future of web development has moved towards sophisticated, responsive and dynamic "single-page" applications running in the browser. Apps like Gmail, Asana, Trello, Facebook and Google Maps have redefined what users expect from "Web Applications" and thus what developers need to be able to deliver. Listening to these industry trends, we've come to the conclusion that full-stack JavaScript is the future of web development. 

### Full Stack Javascript

* [Introduction to Full-stack Javascript development](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/21/introduction-to-full-stack-javascript/)
* [Why Full Stack Javascript](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/faq#why_javascript) - scroll down to the question in FAQ, great response.
* [MEAN Stack Overview](http://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-javascript-development-mean/)

### Technology Stack
The following technology is how I build Full Stack Javascript mobile, web and server applications. The advantage is that many of the technologies can be used on all platforms. If you know these you’ll be doing really well.

* [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. Programming makes computers do what you want them to do. JavaScript is easy to learn.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.js is a platform for building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses a lightweight and efficient model, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.
* [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/#!/) - Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites..
* [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - The newest version of HTML. HTML is a standard markup language used to create web pages.
* [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is a powerful CSS extension language in the world. It makes CSS more powerful.
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) - Less is a CSS extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. It is similar to Sass.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document manipulation, animation, and data communication much simpler
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - AngularJS is an open source web application framework maintained by Google to address many of the challenges encountered in developing web applications.
* [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) - The beautiful, open source front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5.
* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript rather than Objective-c and Java.
* [MEAN Stack](http://mean.io/#!/) - MEAN is an opinionated full stack Javascript framework which simplifies and accelerates web application development.

### Books

* Functional Javascript
* Full-stack Mobile App with Ionic - Only $.99. Kindle only, if you don’t have a Kindle install the app on iPhone, iPad or OSX

### Tutorials

Coming soon. I’m compiling a list of tutorials for getting started. Until then I’d start with the “Learning Websites” above.

I’ll put together tutorials in each stage of learning, beginner, intermediate, ninja for each technology.

10 Best Tutorials To Learn AngularJS 

### Tools

#### Software Editors

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - $99 - the best web development editor for Javascript I know of
* [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - $70 - another good web development tool
* [Atom](https://atom.io) - Free - open source software development editor with plugins for Javascript. Great tool.
* [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/product/) Titanium - Free - A Web/Javascript development editor. Note, this was originally built for Titanium, another mobile technology like Cordova above. I like Cordova, butter, but it is worth looking at later.
* [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) - Kind of for uber nerds, but I do like it.

#### Software Services / Tools

* [Github](http://github.com) - Powerful collaboration, code review, and code management for open source and private projects. 
* [Npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com) - npm is the package manager for Javascript and specifically node applications. Packages are reusable code that you can install in your app to perform certain operations. Do crazy math, talk to Twitter.com, format some text.. don't reinvent the wheel use npm.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - another package manager for Javascript but for browser based applications only.


#### Hardware

Both Windows and OSX are fine for getting started with programming. However I am focused on OSX since it has many parallels with Linux, the operating system that is powering most of the servers on the web.

#### OSX

* Homebrew - Installs important UNIX-like software on your Mac. I used it to install most my software
* CakeBrew - Homebrew GUi to make it easier for people not comfortable with the command line.

#### Servers

Web software runs on servers. Here are a few you can install with Brew that will help out with the tutorials.

* Postgres
* MySQL
* Mongodb
